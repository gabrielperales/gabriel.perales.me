When people talk about Elixir, they usually mention the OTP concurrency model. It's a powerful model that allows you to build scalable and fault-tolerant systems. But what is OTP? And how does it work?

In this post, I want to explain what OTP is and how it works. I'll start by explaining the problems that OTP solves and then I'll explain the OTP concurrency model.

## Problems that OTP solves

- **Concurrency**: concurrency is the ability of a program to handle multiple tasks at the same time. The web server is an example of a concurrent program, it can handle multiple requests at the same time. With the internet era, concurrency became a must-have feature for most applications, and meanwhile other languages were adding concurrency features, Erlang and Elixir born thought to be concurrent languages.

- **Fault-tolerance**: fault-tolerance is the ability of a program to handle failures gracefully. If a process crashes, the program should be able to handle it gracefully and continue running. OTP provides a way to structure your code in a way that makes it easier to handle failures gracefully. This is achieved by having a process supervisor that can restart a crashed process.

- **Scalability**: scalability is the ability of a program to grow in performance and resources when the load increases. The BEAM (Erlang VM), the runtime environment for Erlang and Elixir, is designed to be scalable. It allows you to have thousands of concurrent processes running without a problem. It also allows you to distribute your code across multiple nodes, connected through a network, which allows you to scale your application horizontally.


## OTP Concurrency Model

The OTP concurrency model is based on the concept of **processes**. Processes are the smallest unit of computation in OTP. They are isolated from each other and can run concurrently. Processes communicate with each other using **messages**.
